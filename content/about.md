My name is Bern Carney, short for _Bernard_.

Learning and leveraging new technologies to provide intuitive solutions, is what drives me. Ever since I designed my first website and put together my first computer when I was young, I have been passionate about technology. For the past 9 years I have been expanding that skill-set professionally.

While I would not be part of the 26% that cooks for the office (unless people would eat apple crisp for every meal), I do feel that I would be a great addition to Kenzan's team. I am always seeking new ways to challenge myself and learn something in the process. In fact, this site was created as a direct result of that way of thinking. It was conceived as a way to brush up on my web development skills while also being a unique way to showcase some of my relevant knowledge for the _Project Manager/Business Analyst_ opening with Kenzan. In addition, I sought to learn new web technologies such as Go Templating and static site deployment using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [Github](https://www.github.com). With the amount of times I've worked with CSS, even with how far it has come, it is still a test in patience.

I grew up in Staten Island, New York with two older sisters. 18 years later , after making it out alive , I attended Virginia Tech as a Computer Science major. After a year of late nights debugging code and figuring out how to solve interesting problems, I realized that my skillset and personality were best utilized somewhere else. I graduated with a B.S. in Business and a focus in technology and entrepreneurship where I felt my communication skills and technology know-how could be put to better use.

Working with the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice in the D.C. area, is oddly enough, where my obsession for climbing began. With a spirit for adventure and possibly due to watching _Into the Wild_ one too many times, I packed up my life and moved to Colorado to follow my passion for climbing. That was almost 7 years ago and was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

That's a quick recap of who I am and how I've gotten here. Below you can find more about my skill set as well as professional experience and personal projects.
