My name is Bern Carney, short for _Bernard_.

How different technologies work, and how I can make them work better, is what drives me. Ever since I designed my first website and put together my first computer when I was young, I have been passionate about technology. For the past 9 years I have been expanding that skill-set professionally.

While I would not be part of the 26% that cooks for the office (unless people would eat apple crisp every day), I do feel that I would be a great addition to Kenzan's team. I am always seeking new ways to challenge myself and learn something in the process. In fact, this site was created as a direct result of that way of thinking. It was conceived as a way to apply for the project manager opening with Kenzan while also brushing up on my web development skills and learning new web technologies such as Go Templating, [Bulma](https://bulma.io), _SASS_, and static site deployment using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [Github](https://www.github.com). With the amount of times I've worked with CSS, I can still say, even with how far it has come, that is still a test in patience.
